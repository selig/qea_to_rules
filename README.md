# qea_to_rules

This project contains a Scala Eclipse project implementing a translation from QEA to Rule Systems.

There is a simple implementation of QEA and Rule Systems.

Each step in the translation is then implemented separatey. 

Three examples are given and can be run to print out each stage of the translation and the resulting rule system.
